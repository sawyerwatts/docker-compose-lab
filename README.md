# Docker Funtimes

This repo is a playground for me to get more hands-on with Docker. More specifically:

- Have a .NET API that uses Docker compose to stand up dependencies (if I'm feeling spicy, then
  this'll include DB migrations).
- Have a .NET app that uses the first API as a dependency - the goal is to get familiar with
  writing a client that uses a homegrown API.
